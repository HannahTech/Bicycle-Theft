# Bicycle-Theft
This project involves data analysis, cleaning, and modeling of bicycle theft data. The team loads and explores the dataset, performs data cleaning, and then builds a machine learning pipeline using various algorithms. The final part of the project is a Flask API that serves multiple trained models, allowing users to make predictions and obtain model performance scores.

    - Clean the data by dropping unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
    - Create a machine learning pipeline with preprocessing steps for both numeric and categorical features.
    - Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVM) using GridSearchCV for       hyperparameter tuning.
    - Develop a Flask API with endpoints for making predictions and obtaining model performance scores.
